# W_SpotDetection-Dmap-IJ
This workflow detects spots in a 2D image by filtering the image by Laplacian of Gaussian (user defined radius), thresholding (user defined threshold) and finding local intensity maxima in mask distance map.

## Integration with NEUBIAS web-based database of bioimage analysis tools
